				Hi, i’m Christopher (we met before on the homepage, remember?). This page is a little
				spartan right now as i figure out how to talk about myself without making me cringe. Like i
				said before, i want to focus on this site being personal and not a portfolio site. i want to
				talk about web development, but i want to bifurcate my personal life from my professional
				life, so i plan to repurpose <a
					class="cactus-link inline-block"
					href="https://www.onebrightlight.com">onebrightlight.com</a
				> as that portfolio/resume.
			</p>
			<h2 class="subtitle">Personal</h2>
			<p>
				Real fast because i don’t want this template to look <em>too</em> much like the starter
				theme:
			</p>
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
				<li>
					i’m <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/index.html" class="cactus-link inline-block"
						>ADHD</a
					> and am a huge proponent of stimulants as treatment
				</li>
				<li>In 2013, two days before my birthday, i was diagnosed with HIV</li>
				<li>i’m disastrously bisexual</li>
				<li>
					i’m <a
						href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/what-is-agender"
						class="cactus-link inline-block">agender</a
					> and use they/them pronouns
				</li>
				<li>i live with my spouse and two cats</li>
				<li>
					i spend much of my weekends with my <a
						class="cactus-link inline-block"
						href="https://bsky.app/profile/chimeracoder.bsky.social">other partner/Sir</a
					>, also in New York
				</li>
				<li>
					i love <a class="cactus-link inline-block" href="https://new.mta.info/">public transit</a>
					 and will take it any chance i can
				</li>
				<li>
					i build mechanical keyboards and enjoy woodworking as hobbies, even though my living space
					doesn’t allow much room for either.
				</li>
