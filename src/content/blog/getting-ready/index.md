Before the show, i watch Sir Aditya with intention as He trims and adjusts and fusses about His appearance, yet i think He is perfect as He always is.

There’s something calming and relaxing about the ephemeral moments between relaxing and going out where we transition from our comfort and private lives to presenting our idealized self to the world, and the little rituals we adhere to to get there.
