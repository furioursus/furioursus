On New Year’s Day at [Get Wrecked & Carry](https://www.instagram.com/wreckednyc/?hl=en), [Sir Aditya](https://bsky.app/profile/chimeracoder.bsky.social) & i got to see [DJ Minx](https://www.djminx.us/) spin some of the most uplifting and magical house and techno. It was a beautiful start to 2024.

i’m so thankful that the start of the new year was on such a positive note.
