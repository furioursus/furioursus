i just read Cassidy Williams’s recent blog post, [“I miss human curation”](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/human-curation/) and it really struck a chord in me. i’ve been thinking a lot about algorithms, curation, and intent.

Right out the gate, Cassidy zeroes in on one of my biggest gripes about our reliance on these algorithms:

> The “For You” pages of the world are right, I am interested in that content, but I’m not seeing it from my friends, or that one author I like, or that random blog I found when I was learning about an obscure hobby.

She hits the nail on the head here and to be honest, i’d go a step further and say that it causes these feeds and FYPs to feel soulless and empty. It feels like i am being summarized by an AI system and determining what i’d like without ever really knowing me in the first place. i don’t think that an <abbr title="Large Language Model">LLM</abbr> is the solution for anything other than engorging content consumption.

i don’t want to just consume content: i want to connect with art and knowledge. i want to follow people and topics with intent. i want to feel like i own my own interests and share them with just as much determination.

When we first started dating in 2013, my [spouse Chris](https://bsky.app/profile/pupchompers.bsky.social) and i would share music with one another and listen in my 2008 Scion xD as we drove around San Francisco. They’d introduce me to Bay Area hip-hop that they grew up with and i would share my interests in queercore and acid trip-hop. We shared TV shows and movies that each of us loved and learned more about each other in that process.

Last year, when i was visiting Him while still living on the west coast, [Sir Aditya](https://bsky.app/profile/chimeracoder.bsky.social) and i sat down one night after He learned that i never really listened to [The Smiths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiths) — i was always more of a fan of [The Cure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cure) — and He played [“Some Girls are Bigger than Others”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C906lbkcYug) and other songs off “The Queen is Dead,” as we had just learned that Elizabeth II had just died.

Sharing music and art that is interesting and timely has such a lasting impression and generates and reinforces a feeling of true connection. When all we have to entertain and inform us is a firehose of information, doesn’t that cheapen the experience?

Cassidy sums it up here:

> You can curate it to a point, but companies design these systems this way on purpose.

It’s the antagonism from the companies that bugs me. It’s the [creeping surveilance that they introduce](https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/meta-pay-or-okay-noyb-complaint-2/) and the way they will fight tooth and nail for the [“right” to our identities](https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/a-group-representing-tiktok-meta-and-x-sues-ohio-over-new-law-limiting-kids-use-of-social-media/).

We’re all stuck straddling personas across various feudal states vying for power over one another and ourselves. The only answer i have at this point is to focus on my own curation and sharing content with intent with my partners and my friends, both online and off.

i want to know more about my friends and to be more connected with them. i hope this year sees that trend continue and deepen.
